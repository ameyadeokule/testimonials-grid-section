## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflows

### What I learned

-   Using sudo-selectors
-   Targeting components using nth-child selector
-   Expanding a component over 2 grids

### Continued development

Covert the design to use Material UI and/or TailwindCSS and convert the project into ReactJS

### Useful resources

-   [CSS Tricks for Grid ](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Helped to understand CSS grid fragments.

-   [A Complete Guide to CSS Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand breakpoints and how to handle HTML elements on a much smaller screen using CSS media queries.
